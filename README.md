A comprehensive resource management and tracking portal with Discord authentication and role-based access control. Perfect for gaming communities, organizations, and teams that need to track shared resources, inventory, or assets.
It was designed for Dune Awakening, but technically this could be used to track anything. Currently the only auth is Discord and it works with a TursoDB (Which you can get for free) but in the future maybe we can add more database types.
I originall made this for [https://www.silverorder.org)](https://www.silverorder.org) there shouldn't be any references to that, but if there is feel free to submit a PR to fix them.

Honestly I leave this project in the hands of the open source community, if you can build it and it works, I'll approve the pull request üôè

If you like what i did feel free to
